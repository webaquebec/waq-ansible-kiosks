# WAQ Ansible Kiosks 

> Setup the cluster of raspberry pi for displays at Web à Québec with Ansible

## Setup

Setup your hosts address in `hosts`.

You can set the kiosks URL to display as `kiosk_url` in `playbook.yml`.

Each host will open the URL with a query string with the hostname ex: 

    http://google.com/?kiosk=qcumpi-4

## Quick start

Run ansible with ask for password first time :

    ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i hosts --ask-pass

Then you can skip pass since authorized keys are setup :

    ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i hosts
